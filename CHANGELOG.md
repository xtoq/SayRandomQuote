# Changelog

* v7.0 (WoW version 7.0.3)
  * *202% smarter!* - Now SRQ will choose a group channel to say your random stuff in by default. If you don't pass a channel with the slash command, SRQ will choose from default chat channels in this order: Instance, Raid, Party, Say.
  * *457% less confusing versioning!* - Updated versioning system. Now major version number will follow the current WoW version number. I don't know why I didn't do it this way before.
  * *89% more generic!* - Added more generic quotesets. This should make the addon pretty decent out of the box for most use cases.
  * *~969% wordier!* - Updated the description page to be much more comprehensive.
  * *100% more Legion!* - Updated TOC for Legion pre-patch.
* v8.5 - Added the ability to set a channel in which to say your random quote. Currently supports only default channels, not custom channels.
* v8.5b - ToC update.
